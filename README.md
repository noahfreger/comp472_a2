# COMP472 - Mini Project 2
https://github.com/noahfreger/comp472_a2

## Requirements
* Use Python 3.7 (Using the PyPy runtime https://www.pypy.org/)
* Ensure initial requirements from requirements.txt are installed
* If you are unable to install numpy from the registry, you can use the `whl` file this way (assuming the pypy installation is in the path): 
```
pypy3 -m pip install numpy-1.21.4vanilla-pp37-pypy37_pp73-win_amd64.whl
```

## Running with Game trace
1. Run Line_em_up.py this way:
```
c:/{location path of pypy installation}/python.exe c:/{location path of project}/comp472_a2/Line_em_up.py
```
2. Follow user input directions to run game trace
3. Change in main `user_input=False` for manual parameters

## Running Scoreboard
1. Run Line_em_up.py this way:
```
c:/{location path of pypy installation}/python.exe c:/{location path of project}/comp472_a2/Line_em_up.py
```
3. View resulting `scoreboard.txt` file
